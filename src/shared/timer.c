/*
 * timer.c - Game tick clock for the native SDL build.
 *
 * The game keeps time in four byte counters that callers reset to 0 and then
 * poll until they reach some target ("wait N ticks"), plus an optional per-tick
 * hook egame uses for frame pacing and palette cycling. The tick rate is 60 Hz.
 *
 * Rather than a background thread, the counters advance on the main thread from
 * a monotonic clock: timerPump() adds however many 60 Hz ticks have elapsed
 * since it last ran and fires the hook once per tick. This keeps the hook's work
 * (palette cycle, frame-sync flags) synchronized with rendering instead of
 * racing it. timerPump() is called from the input pump and from timerYield(),
 * so every wait loop that polls a counter advances time as it spins.
