 * Pre-mission briefing (START mission-select) widescreen HD art. Unlike the sprites
 * above — which replace a sprite inside the 320-space overlay box — the briefing
 * room fills the whole window (the officer stands in the wide margins, outside the
 * 4:3 game box), so these draw with a window-fill transform, not a 320-space
 * footprint. Wall and arm cels share the same HEIGHT (drawn at the same window-height
 * scale so the forearm meets the officer's body); the wall is centred, while each arm
 * cel is left-aligned within the 4:3 menu box it points into (its extra width tucks
 * behind the officer) — see BRIEFING_ARM_BOX_LEFT_X in hdsprite.c.

 *                                      raise-in/lower-out sweep); a missing pose draws
 *                                      no arm for that frame.
 *
 * All are GPU-only and optional; a missing file falls back to the legacy
 * Wall.Pic / ArmPiece.Pic. Must be called inside an active native-overlay frame.
