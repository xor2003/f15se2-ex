/* OpenGL 1.x 3D backend — the GPU path.
 *
 * Implements the R3DBackend 3D vtable against the *decoded* meshes (r3dmesh.c)
 * and owns the GL context + the 2D-overlay composite. The 3D main view
 * renders through GL at native window resolution with a real depth buffer and
 * double-sided fill (no back-face cull — cheap on a GPU, fixes over-optimized
 * models). The target-model MFD sub-view (renderScene == 0) also renders through
 * GL, into a scissored sub-viewport over a backdrop snapshotted from the page (the
 * game fills that MFD region with a two-tone horizon before submitting the model).
 *
 * Transform faithfulness: rather than re-derive the camera math in float (and
 * risk a matrix-convention bug), each object reuses the exact integer
 * orientation+origin the software path computes (r3d_objTransformFar), and the
 * decoded mesh vertices are projected with a GL matrix built to reproduce the
 * software perspective divide (the >>8 focal scale, 3/4 Y aspect, depth divide).
 * Pixels may drift from the integer rasterizer; behaviour does not (Q1).
 *
 * Compositing (interim): the software 2D page is drawn over the GL 3D as a
 * single flat textured quad with the show-through key (GFX_GL_SHOWTHROUGH_KEY)
 * made transparent, so the HUD/cockpit land on top of the GL viewport. A later
 * step submits 2D through the renderer too (docs/render-2d-overlay.md).
