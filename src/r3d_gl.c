/* OpenGL 1.x 3D backend — the GPU path.
 *
 * Implements the R3DBackend 3D vtable against the *decoded* meshes (r3dmesh.c)
 * and owns the GL context + the 2D-overlay composite. The 3D main view
 * renders through GL at native window resolution with a real depth buffer and
 * double-sided fill (no back-face cull — cheap on a GPU, fixes over-optimized
 * models). The target-model MFD sub-view (renderScene == 0) also renders through
 * GL, into a scissored sub-viewport over a backdrop snapshotted from the page (the
 * game fills that MFD region with a two-tone horizon before submitting the model).
 *
 * Transform faithfulness: rather than re-derive the camera math in float (and
 * risk a matrix-convention bug), each object reuses the exact integer
 * orientation+origin the software path computes (r3d_objTransformFar), and the
 * decoded mesh vertices are projected with a GL matrix built to reproduce the
 * software perspective divide (the >>8 focal scale, 3/4 Y aspect, depth divide).
 * Pixels may drift from the integer rasterizer; behaviour does not (Q1).
 *
 * Compositing: the 2D overlay draws IMMEDIATELY over the GL 3D at native window
 * resolution, in true call order (r3dgl_draw*, driven from r2d_submit*). The
 * retained software page still carries the cockpit/panel + on-change gauges; it is
 * composited once per flight frame as a textured quad at the main-scene anchor
 * (gl_endScene, before the frame's HUD), with the 3D viewport rect(s) made
 * transparent so the GL 3D shows beneath. Pure-2D screens (menus/briefing/debrief)
 * have no 3D pass and composite the page at present instead.
