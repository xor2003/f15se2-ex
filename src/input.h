 * (eginput.c: kbhit/egReadKey) and the menu/splash/debrief loops (ovlimpl.c:
 * misc_checkKeyBuf/misc_getKey). Window-level events - quit, Alt+Enter
 * fullscreen, focus, gamepad hotplug, audio-device add/remove - are handled
 * uniformly here regardless of phase. Only the keyboard/gamepad *meaning* is
 * context-dependent (arrows are the virtual stick in flight but cursor keys in
 * menus; letters are commands in flight but localized text entry in menus), so
 * the pump carries an explicit mode.
