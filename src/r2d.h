 * renderer as the in-flight 3D path (r3d.h) — there is no separate 2D backend.
 *
 * This seam owns the present/compose boundary and the image/primitive submission
 * path. The game draws into the 320x200 paletted page surfaces (gfx_impl.c), and
 * the seam owns *how that virtual overlay page reaches the window*. The software
 * backend presents it through SDL_Renderer (letterbox); the GL backend composites
 * it as a flat textured quad over the GL 3D (r3dgl_present). The active 2D backend
 * always matches the active 3D backend: the GL backend owns the window, so the two
 * must agree.

 * Virtual-vs-real resolution.

 * the hi-res title). R2DMapping is the uniform-scale + centring placement of
 * that box onto the real window (letterbox/pillarbox bars on the unused axis).
 *
 * r2d_computeMapping is the SINGLE source of truth for the virtual->window
 * mapping: the software present, the GL 2D composite and the GL 3D viewport all
 * derive their placement from it, so the HUD, the 3D and the present quad stay
 * aligned and nothing stretches on non-1.6 displays.
 *
 * Submission contract: 2D is authored inside the virtual box, but a submission
 * MAY fall outside it (oversized, reserved for future widescreen 2D art) — out-
 * of-box pixels are clipped to the window, NOT to the virtual box. No stock call
 * site relies on this; the stock UI never leaves the box.
